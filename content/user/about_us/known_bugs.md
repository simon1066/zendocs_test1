<!-- RELEASETIME - update -->

For every release, a known bugs thread is created on the Zen Cart forum
to provide an easy way of tracking the issues that have been resolved.
These bugs are fixed in the next release, so if you are not on the latest
release, [doing an upgrade](/user/upgrading/) is the best way to get the fix.
