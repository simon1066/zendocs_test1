As noted in [Basics - Hosting and Domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/#hosting-companies): 
- Your easiest installation option will be a Linux host running Apache with cPanel.
- The decision on whether to use Shared or VPS hosting will be determined by your budget, but VPS is recommended.
- The Zen Cart project recommends a number of hosting providers on
their [Recommended Services](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?3-services) page.

### SSLLabs Evaluation

One way to evaluate hosts is to run the [test offered by SSLLabs](https://ssllabs.com/ssltest).  You will want to make sure any host you consider has an "A" or "A+" rating.  

   A highly rated host will help make any PCI scan you run more likely to succeed.  The more secure your host, the more secure your site.

   Here's an example of an excellent report:
