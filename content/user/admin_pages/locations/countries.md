## Disabling/Enabling Countries

In your Admin->Locations/Taxes->Countries screen, you can click on the green "status" icon to toggle the country's status off. The screen updates immediately with the change. If you don't see the country alphabetically in the list, it may have been previously disabled.  This moves a country to the end of the list, clicking the red icon will turn the country back on.
