Coupons can be restricted in the following ways:

- not applying to specific products
- only applying to specific products 

### Creating a restriction 
First set a restriction on:
Top category DENY

Next, start adding the Categories and/or Products that are ALLOWED.

You can mix the Categories and Products on the restrictions. 

By setting the Top Category to DENY then you will only permit what has then been added as an ALLOW to work with the Discount Coupon.
