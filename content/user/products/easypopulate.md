### EasyPopulate 

Rather than enter products one-by-one in the admin panel, some storeowners prefer to use tools that will import a CSV containing product information.  One such tool is called EasyPopulate.  Other spellings of this name include:

- "Easy Populate"
- "EZPopulate" 
- "EZ-Populate" 

You can find [EasyPopulate in the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2069).  Many versions exist; the one version linked here is the most recent and well supported. 

Notes on using EasyPopulate: 
- Loading data is a two-step process: first you upload the file, then you import the data.
- The key for product data imports is the model number field.  You may wish to use [Find Duplicate Models](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1323) as an aid to making your model numbers unique if you suspect you have duplicates.
