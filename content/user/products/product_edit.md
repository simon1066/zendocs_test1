The product editing screen is reached by going to [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/), and then navigating down to [the product level](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) and editing a specific product. 

The screen allows you to set all the product fields available to 
that product type.  It is used for both product creation and product editing.
