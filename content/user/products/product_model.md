The field _product model_ is used by some stores as a unique identifier to track items in the store. Some vendors call this a SKU or stock keeping unit. 

Using a model number is completely optional, and won't make sense for some stores. 

If you do use model numbers, you may wish to ensure that they are unique. The plugin [Find Duplicate Models](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1323) may be used for this.   This process is very important for stores that use Quickbooks or other external systems that require unique model identifiers.
