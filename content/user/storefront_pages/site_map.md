Since Zen Cart 1.3.0, a storefront sitemap has been automatically produced.  The purpose of this sitemap is to provide visitors with a single place to see all the categories in the store.  It's just another mechanism for your customers to discover what's in your store. 

Other pages are also included in the Site Map, such the [Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/), [Advanced Search Page](/user/search/storefront_search/#advanced-search-page) and [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/).

This site map is produced for the benefit of human visitors, and should not be confused with an [XML sitemap](/user/search/xml_site_map/), which is produced for the benefit of search engines. 

The site map may be accessed at the URL `index.php?main_page=site_map`.  There is frequently a link to the site map in a store's footer, header or a sidebox.
