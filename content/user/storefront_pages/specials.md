The specials page shows all the products in your store which are currently on special.  The list is presented in a grid format with pagination.  The special price reduction is shown prominently in red, and the original price is marked with strikethrough.

Other places specials are shown: 

- [Specials sidebox](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/#specials)
- [Specials centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

Since the specials sidebox and centerbox only display a small subset of products on special, the products shown are chosen at random.  The specials page shows all products on special, so the order is fixed. 

Unlike the [listing page layout](/user/template/listing_page_layout), where items are shown in rows, the specials page looks like the home page,  with one main [centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/) showing items in a grid.
